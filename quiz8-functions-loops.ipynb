    "**Question 2: Detecting the First Signal Peak Above a Threshold**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python function `threshold_peak` that takes a sequence of signal strength measurements (represented as a list of integers) as a variable `signal`. The goal is to identify the first measurement that exceeds a predefined `threshold` value, which indicates the occurrence of a significant signal peak. Once a peak exceeding the threshold is found, the program should return the *index* (position) of this measurement in the dataset and the *value* of the peak, as a tuple then terminate the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "1. Write a function `threshold_peak` that takes two input arguments: `signal` (a list of integers) and `threshold` (an integer).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. Use a for loop to iterate through the signal_measurements list.\n",
    "Within the loop, implement a condition to check if the current measurement exceeds the threshold.\n",
    "      1. Print the index of the first measurement that exceeds the threshold and the value of this measurement. The print statement should read `First signal peak above threshold found at index <index> with value <value>.`, where `<index>` and `<value>` are the index and value of the first measurement that exceeds the threshold.\n",
    "      2. If a measurement exceeding the threshold is found, use a return statement to exit the loop immediately and return a tuple containing the index of the measurement and the value of the measurement.\n",
    "      3. If no measurement exceeds the threshold, print a message: `No significant signal peak was detected above the threshold of <threshold>.`, where `<threshold>` is the value of the threshold.\n",
